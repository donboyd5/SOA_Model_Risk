# Discussion items for first meeting

-   Project overview and plans

-   Progress to date

-   Selected assumptions and issues:

    -   We focus on annual periods as being appropriate for pension funds (not monthly, weekly, daily, ...)
    
    -   We focus on longer time frames as being appropriate for pension funds -- e.g., (10, 20, 30, 40 years)
    
    -   We have not yet chosen pension-related measures for evaluating differences across model structures and parameterizations

    -   Technical: Calibration of probability-distribution returns to random normal
    
    -   Other?

-   What's ahead
