# Measures to describe investment returns

We use the following measures to describe the characteristics of investment returns.

## Measures to describe a single time period (or for all time periods taken together)

**Mean**: We use the arithmetic mean of returns unless stated otherwise.

**Standard Deviation**: We use the sample standard deviation as our standard measure of volatility.

**Skewness**: We use skewness to measure the asymmetry of the return distribution. Positive skewness indicates a longer tail on the right, and negative skewness a longer tail on the left. (Currently, we use the type 1 measure from the r package e1071, a standard textbook version.) When investment returns are negatively skewed, we may expect frequent small gains and a few large losses.

**Excess Kurtosis**: Excess kurtosis measures the "fat-tailedness" of the return distribution, relative to the normal distribution. Positive values indicate heavier tails and a higher likelihood of extreme returns compared to a normal distribution. (Currently, we use the type 1 measure from the r package e1071, a standard textbook version. Note that kurtosis measures can be misleading, particularly for multimodal distributions but our data generally will have a single mode. They also can be misleading when there are substantial outliers.)

The plot below (taken from [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/172467/what-is-the-meaning-of-tail-of-kurtosis)) shows density curves for a normal distribution and for a t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. The t distribution has fat tails (its density line is above the normal line in the tails); it also has a higher peak (more values clustered around the mean).

We'll use histograms with density curves for our initial visualization of skewness and kurtosis, but because relatively few observations are in the tails, to get a clearer picture we'll use q-q plots which show tails more clearly. This will be apparent in the section on historical investment returns.
