# Investment returns generated by probability distributions

This section examines investment returns generated by probability distributions:

-   Simple time-independent random normal distribution portfolio-returns

-   Time-independent fat-tailed returns

-   Multivariate normal distribution with returns correlated over time

## Calibrating investment returns

We can use the Y = a + b \* X (with b \> 0) transformation to achieve a specific mean and standard deviation for Y while maintaining the same probability distribution and shape as X. To accomplish this, we need to calculate the appropriate values for 'a' and 'b' based on the desired mean and standard deviation for Y.

Let's say the mean and standard deviation of X are μ_X and σ_X, respectively, and we want the mean and standard deviation of Y to be μ_Y and σ_Y, respectively. We can calculate the values for 'a' and 'b' as follows:


2.  Solve for 'b' first:

σ_Y = \|b\| \* σ_X

Since b \> 0, we can ignore the absolute value:

σ_Y = b \* σ_X

Rearrange:

b = σ_Y / σ_X


2.  Solve for 'a':

μ_Y = a + b \* μ_X

Rearrange:

a = μ_Y - b \* μ_X


Use 'a' and 'b' to generate Y = a + b \* X, which will have the desired mean and standard deviation while maintaining the same probability distribution and shape as X.
