Equity indices (indeed, all asset classes) tend to exhibit consistent risk/reward relationships over long time horizons.\n\n2.  Cumulative equity returns tend to exceed the compounded risk-free rate (positive observed equity risk premium) over long time horizons, but over short time horizons, the observed equity risk premium fluctuates due to several factors and can be negative.\n\n3.  Equities fluctuate between bull and bear markets (bubbles tend to burst) --- markets can experience significant losses but eventually tend to move back into positive territory (negative cumulative equity returns become less likely over longer time horizons).\n\n4.  Cumulative equity returns over long time horizons are not materially impacted by initial market conditions.\n\n5.  The volatility of equity returns varies over time but has a strong tendency to quickly revert to normative levels. This allows for both extreme gains and extreme losses over short time periods (i.e., the distribution has fat tails, or positive kurtosis). Furthermore, the volatility of equity returns is higher in bear markets. This increases the probability of extreme losses relative to extreme gains (i.e., the distribution has a longer left tail, or negative skewness).\n\n6.  Equity markets contain pathwise dynamics over long time horizons that aren't present in the distribution of single-period returns. Future equity scenarios should have reasonable distributions of cumulative equity returns over long time horizons (e.g., 10, 20, 30 years), especially since these distributions are key to the performance of long-duration life and annuity products.\n\n7.  Future equity scenarios should include events that are plausibly more extreme than history.\n\n8.  Equity returns have both a price and dividend component, and they behave differently---dividend returns tend to be more stable than price returns.\n\n9.  Returns between different equity indices are generally positively correlated over long time horizons. This correlation may increase sharply in bear markets, but it tends to revert to normative levels in a short period of time.\n\n## Historical Returns on U.S. Stocks, Bonds and Bills: 1928-2022\n\nThe following uses data compiled by Aswath Damodaran at New York University. The asset classes are:\n\n-   baacorp - Moody's Aaa and Baa corporate bonds, average\n\n-   cpiu - Consumer Price Index, all urban consumers\n\n-   gold - year-end price\n\n-   realestate - residential, similar to Case-Schiller index\n\n-   sp500 - S&P 500 index total return (including dividends)\n\n-   tbill3 - 3-month Treasury bill, average rate for the year\n\n-   ustbond - 10-year constant maturity Treasury bond\n\nFor details, see the documentation in the [Appendix](appdx_damodaran_data.qmd).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Plot the series\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](irfacts_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Comparison to normality\n\n#### Individual assets\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](irfacts_files/figure-html/plot-normal-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Auto correlation over time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](irfacts_files/figure-html/plot-acf-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Correlation across asset classes\n\nHow to read a correlation plot:\n\n-   Diagonal shows a kernel density curve for each asset class (similar to a normal curve for normally distributed data, but for the actual data for a given investment class).\n\n-   Upper triangle shows correlation coefficent between two asset classes.\n\n-   Lower triangle shows scatterplot for 2 asset classes. To find the scatterplot associated with a given correlation coefficient, look along the southwest diagonal from the correlation, counting the same number of boxes on the lower side of the diagonal as it is on the upper side.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](history_corrplot.png)\n\n## Portfolios\n\nI've constructed 3 stocks-bonds portfolios (sp500-baacorp): 75-25, 50-50, and 25-75.\n",
