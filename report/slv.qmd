## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| output: false

source(here::here("report", "_common.R"))
source(here::here("report", "libraries_ts.R"))


library(quantmod)
library(stats4)
library(stochvolTMB)
library(stochvol)

# library(rstan)
# library(V8)
# options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
# rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) # avoids recompiling

```

## Get and show main ACLI parameters

```{r}
#| label: get-params

# ddir <- r"(E:\data\soa\acli)"
# base_dir <- "s_baseline"
# base_fn <- "baseline_ACLI_v1.46 Alt3 12-2020 100yrs.xlsm"

fpath <- fs::path(ddir, base_dir, base_fn)

## equity parameters ----

eqparams1 <- read_excel(fpath, sheet="Parameters", range = "H32:M44")

eqparams <- eqparams1 |> 
  select(symbol=1, usdiverse=2, intldiverse=3, intermedrisk=4, aggressive=5, desc=6) |> 
  filter(row_number() > 1) |> 
  mutate(across(-c(symbol, desc), as.numeric)) |> 
  mutate(vname=case_when(
    symbol == "sigma(v)" ~ "sigma_v",
    symbol == "sigma(0)" ~ "sigma_0",
    symbol == "sigma-" ~ "sigma_min",
    symbol == "sigma+" ~ "sigma_max",
    symbol == "sigma*" ~ "sigma_star",
    .default = symbol)
    ) |> 
  relocate(vname, .before = desc)
eqparams  

# col_types = cols(.default = col_character())

## interest rate parameters ----

intparams1 <- read_excel(fpath, sheet="Parameters", range = "B2:F39")

intparams <- intparams1 |> 
  select(vname=1, default=3, desc=5) |> 
  filter(row_number() > 1) |>

## Get data

AIRG used the following data. ACLI used the same data as AIRG for equities.

## Diversified Large Cap U.S. Equity ----
# Dec 1955-Dec 2003 monthly was period used in AIRG for sp500
# Download adjusted close prices for the S&P 500 index
# monthly data do not go back far enough so get daily and convert
spdaily <- getSymbols("^GSPC", auto.assign = FALSE, from = "1950-01-01")
saveRDS(spdaily, here::here("data", "sp500_index_rawdaily.rds"))

## Diversified International Equity ----
# MSCI-EAFE $USD Total Return Index, 1969.12 – 2003.12
# MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index - This is a broad index that represents the performance of large and mid-cap stocks across 21 developed markets, excluding the U.S. and Canada. It covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country.
# The MSCI EAFE Index itself does not have a ticker symbol, as it is not an investable security but rather a benchmark index. However, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that track the performance of the MSCI EAFE Index.
# https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/822e3d18-16fb-4d23-9295-11bc9e07b8ba
# The most popular and widely traded ETF that tracks the MSCI EAFE Index is the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, which has the ticker symbol "EFA". It's only available since 2001.

mscidaily <- getSymbols("EFA", auto.assign = FALSE, from = "1950-01-01") # 2001+
saveRDS(mscidaily, here::here("data", "msci_eafe_eaf_rawdaily.rds"))

## Intermediate Risk Equity, U.S. Small Capitalization Index, 1955.12 – 2003.12 ----
# U.S. Small Capitalization Index

# The Russell 2000 is perhaps the most well-known and widely referenced small-cap index in the U.S. It measures the performance of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000 Index, which represents approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000.
# ^RUT only available from 1987-09-10 forward

# The S&P SmallCap 600 is another prominent index that measures the small-cap
# segment of the U.S. equity market. Managed by Standard & Poor's, it includes
# 600 small companies that meet specific inclusion criteria, such as market
# capitalization, liquidity, and financial viability.

r2000daily <- getSymbols("^RUT", auto.assign = FALSE, from = "1950-01-01") # 1987-09-10 forward
# getSymbols("^SP600", auto.assign = FALSE, from = "1950-01-01") # 1989-01-03
saveRDS(r2000daily, here::here("data", "russell2000_rawdaily.rds"))

## Aggressive Equity, Emerging Markets, NASDAQ, Hang Seng, 1984.12 – 2003.12 ----

# The hypothetical “Aggressive/Exotic Equity” index was constructed by blending
# returns for the NASDAQ, Emerging Markets and Hang Seng indices (weights are
# approximately 12.5%, 25% and 62.5% respectively). This proxy has an
# unconditional annualized volatility of approximately 25%. This market mix is
# not meant to suggest a representative asset profile for this class, but used
# merely to build an historic index with high volatility and sufficient history.

```


## Prepare data for estimation

Create files with monthly prices and log returns.

```{r}
#| label: get-sp500

# get previously downloaded and saved data

spdaily <- readRDS(here::here("data", "sp500_index_rawdaily.rds"))

spmonthly <- spdaily |> 
  to.monthly(OHLC=FALSE) |> 
  fortify.zoo() |> # to dataframe with Index from rowname
  select(date=Index, sp500=GSPC.Adjusted) |> 
  # we can safely assume data are sorted by date
  mutate(lr=log(sp500 / lag(sp500))) # note that we lose lr for the first observation

# skim(spmonthly)

```
