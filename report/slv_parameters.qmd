# not meant to suggest a representative asset profile for this class, but used
# merely to build an historic index with high volatility and sufficient history.

# NASDAQ:
# For the NASDAQ-100 Index, the ticker is QQQ:
# Invesco QQQ Trust is an ETF that tracks the NASDAQ-100 Index, which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
# For the broader NASDAQ Composite Index, there isn't a direct ETF because it includes over 3,000 stocks. However, the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) is often used as a proxy due to its heavy technology and growth-oriented composition.

# ETF Ticker: EEM
# iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is one of the most popular ETFs tracking the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It includes large and mid-sized companies across emerging markets.

## Key result: equity parameter estimates and uncertainty

The goal of this exercise is to develop parameter-uncertainty estimates for AIRG-ACLI equity parameters, so that we can run different scenarios with the ACLI model using "principled" variations in parameter estimates, rather than arbitrary variations in parameter estimates as we did in our last meeting with the POG. The POG had complained about the arbitrariness of our scenarios.

*(I call the parameters the AIRG-ACLI parameters because the equity models and parameter estimates are identical between the AIRG and ACLI models -- parameters and models only differ for interest rates, not for equities.)*

The table below shows:

-   Reported key parameters for the AIRG-ACLI equity models, for the 4 asset classes in those models. According to AIRG documentation, these models were estimated with a version of a stochastic log volatility model that allows the volatility of asset price to be correlated with the asset price.

-   Parameters and standard errors for similar assets, estimated by me as follows:

    -   the data are for assets that are highly-similar to the AIRG-ACLI asset classes, but they are not identical to the AIRG-ACLI classes
    
    -   the time periods are as long as possible with the available data, and thus are not the same as the time periods used by AIRG-ACLI
    
    -   I estimated the parameters and their standard errors using the R package stochvolTMB. I estimated them using a stochastic volatility model with leverage -- a variant that allows asset price volatility to be correlated with asset price, and thus, presumably, highly similar to the model used by AIRG-ACLI
    
    -   90% margins of error (`moe90`) for the stochvolTMB parameter estimates, calculated as stderr * critical z value (which is approximately 1.645)
    
-   Estimated lower and upper bounds for the AIRG-ACLI parameters, **obtained by applying the stochvolTMB-estimated margins of errors to the AIRG-ACLI parameters**. I think this is a reasonable approach given what we have to work with, but of course it is worth discussing.

```


The next table shows scenarios in a way that will be easy to use to run ACLI variants.

```{r}
#| label: show-scenarios

scenarios_ordered |> 
  kable()

```


## Next steps

My plan is to replace the arbitrary scenarios I ran for our last POG meeting with the following "principled" scenarios based on the lower and upper bounds estimated above:

-   4 lower bound scenarios, one for each  parameter (tau, phi, sigma_v, rho): set the parameter to its lower bound for all asset classes

-   4 upper bound scenarios, one for each  parameter (tau, phi, sigma_v, rho): set the parameter to its upper bound for all asset classes

-   That gives a total of 8 scenarios. However, you may recall that the AIRG-ACLI model is flawed in that it does not implement rho properly and never has any variation in results. Thus, as a practical matter, this gives only 6 scenarios - a lot fewer than we showed the POG, which is good.

I will then update our recent work by:

-   Running the scenarios through the ACLI model (by manually varying the parameters in the spreadsheet, doing 6 separate runs with the spreadsheet)
-   Getting the results (in R) and constructing 2 portfolios from the asset-class results -- high equity, and high fixed.
-   Running the weighted returns from those 2 portfolios for the 6 scenarios through our pension model, and
-   Applying our 4 risk measures
-   Producing your Tables 1 and 2

I should be able to get this done on Monday.

These leaves two issues (I think):

-   It does not deal with interest rate parameters. I have ideas but don't know if we have time.
-   It does not deal with rho in the equity models, which could be important, but I don't konw. I have ideas but don't know if we have time.
